  - Round Robin (with Quantum Time input)

- ✅ **Interactive Inputs**:
  - Add process data dynamically (arrival time, burst time, priority, quantum)
  - Modify or delete existing processes

- ✅ **Real-Time Gantt Chart Visualization**:
  - Visualize process execution order
  - Animated or color-coded display

- ✅ **Results Table**:
  - Shows each process’s metrics
  - Calculates averages automatically

- ✅ **Responsive UI**:
